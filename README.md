# About

This is a RAT written in Python which allows you to remotely access any windows machine.It's not too much complex but is still very Powerful.I have learnt making this RAT over cybrary.it and I am thankful to them.I have made some changes to it as well and hope will go long with this project.

# Working

Just trick the victim to download and run server.py file.Thereafter,all you need to do is run client.py on your local machine and enjoy remote execution of commands on victim's machine.
Make sure to replace victims_ip_address in line 18 with the actual ip of victim.

Hope you will like it.
